A simple Python script to use Linux Terminal commands and other commands 
such as keyboard shorcuts and etc. It works by getting a String output
that represents user's input voice from the microphone of his device
and performing the desired action via voice command. The transcription
from voice to text in real time is performed by the Julius speech
engine.
