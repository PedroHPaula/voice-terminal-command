# Overview
A simple Python script to use Linux Terminal commands and other commands, 
such as keyboard shortcuts. It works by getting a String output
that represents user's input voice from the microphone of his device
and performing the desired action via voice command. The transcription
from voice to text in real time is performed by the [Julius](https://github.com/julius-speech/julius) speech
engine.
# How to use
To run the script you will need (besides the dependencies listed below) to open a Linux Terminal and execution permission.
After that the open terminal window will keep listening to the inputs from the microphone and trying to validate the spoken
sentences into valid actions. The specific sentence <b>"TERMINAL SILENCE"</b> is reserved to be used when you want to exit the script.
You could also interrupt it using <b>Ctrl+C</b> in the terminal where it was called.
# Dependencies
You basically need the following dependencies before running the script:
- A Python 3 interpreter (installation depends on the Linux Distro you are using)
- The [pynput library](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) (same as above)
- The Julius binary as well as the related acoustic model files, configuration file and voca and grammar files

The Julius dependencies are all already present in this repo. The binary, the acoustic model files as well as the dictionary of all possible recognizable words is the latest provided by the [VoxForge project](https://www.voxforge.org/). The "`terminal.voca`" and "`terminal.grammar`" files define the set of all words that we want to recognize and the possible sentences in which they can be arranged. The remaining "`terminal.*`" files can be generated by calling the Perl script "`mkdfa.pl`" with "terminal" as its argument.
Finally, the "`terminal.jconf`" file contains all the options and high-level configurations applied to improve Julius recognition.
